# Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning

Performing thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cleaning the dataset are not only essential steps, but also a great opportunity to lay the foundation for a strong machine learning model.

I used the Ames housing data set to predict home sale prices given a diverse range of features. In this post, I will cover different techniques I applied to explore and clean the data before applying different modeling techniques.

## Overview of the Data

The Ames Housing Dataset is [publicly available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) and is a great dataset to develop analytical skills. The data set also includes a data dictionary that provides a high-level description of each column.

## How I Applied Data Analysis Principles to This Problem

- **Understand the problem.** I'll look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem.
- **Univariable study.** I'll just focus on the dependent variable ("SalePrice") and try to know a little bit more about it.
- **Multivariate study.** I'll try to understand how the dependent variable and independent variables relate.
- **Basic cleaning.** I'll clean the dataset and handle the missing data, outliers and categorical variables.
- **Test assumptions.** I'll check if our data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques.

Now, let's dive into our data!
